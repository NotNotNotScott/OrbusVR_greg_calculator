## Code structure

`index.js` remains the entry point. Supporting JavaScript lives under `js/`:

- `simulation/` - attack-pattern parsing and fight simulation.
- `optimization/` - tileset searches and refinement.
- `ui/` - chart initialization and calculation displays.
- `config/` - loadout data and game constants.
- `utils/` - combination and time helpers.
- `classes/` - class-specific attacks and data.
